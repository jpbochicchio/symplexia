# Basic Outline
This is a rust implementation of the **JavaPlex** package for persistent homology and topological data analysis. JAvaPlex was originally written in Java, a personal favorite of mine, so a conversion to rust seemed quite natural. You can find a link to the original Java project [here](https://github.com/appliedtopology/javaplex).

I like the name JavaPlex for the Java version, but "RustPlex" doesn't have a particularly nice ring to it. Hence, symplexia.

# Project Roadmap
This project is extremely bare-bones for now. I'd like to implement everything included in the Java version of JavaPlex before calling this project "complete"
